# Pursuit-Core-iOS-UserDefaults-Lab


Use the endpoint at: http://sandipbgt.com/theastrologer/api/horoscope/gemini/today to build a Horoscope app.


This app will have two states:

- No user defaults set
- User defaults set


When the app loads (App Delegate), it should check User Defaults to see whether a user's information was saved with a name and birthday
 

### State -  No user defaults (aka first launch)

In this state there are no defaults saved. Prompt the user to add and save this info. However you choose: present a UI that lets them select their birthday information.  Save the birthday into UserDefaults.  Then, show a VC that displays their horoscope information to them.


### State - Defaults are saved (aka subsequent launches)

Immediately present the user's current horoscope.

Your user should always be able to edit their name and birthday and return different results upon later launches.
